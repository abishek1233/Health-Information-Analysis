Based on [[1]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58740-6_6) and the course slides, you should answer the following questions:\n",

    " Document that offers rules, guidelines, or characteristics for practices or their outcomes in the field of health information and communications technology, as determined by evidence and consensus, and authorized by a recognized body.The main purpose being supporting interoperability and guiding safe and efficient HI practice are the two key objectives. The ‘functional use' of standards, on the other hand, is perhaps the most important, we use standards to direct what we do and to measure conformance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Answer for question 2: \n",
    "The creation of an international, open-access HI framework faces two major challenges. To begin with, they are international and open access, as their name implies. To begin with, cooperation inside national boundaries is difficult enough, let alone outside them. Especially if there is a language barrier to overcome. Some people may be overwhelmed by the complexity of this project. Furthermore, the majority of the work is performed by volunteers, which can restrict the number of specialized specialists available as well as the rate at which things will advance. This is a significant challenge, particularly given how quickly technology is evolving. In addition, we must recognise the challenge of developing accessible HI documents in which caregivers recognize the system's importance and are committed to maintaining expectations. It must be incorporated into all caregivers' workflows, which isn't always the case, which is why defined guidelines are often disregarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Answer for question 3: \n",
    "In addition to the problems already listed, such as large-scale connectivity and interoperability, we must also consider the question of security. The privacy and protection of information is becoming an extremely large issue as more data becomes available, which can almost certainly be obtained with the aid of new emerging applications, etc.This will have to be discussed when the HI requirements are introduced and will need to be revised on a daily basis, at a rate that is expected to surpass the existing rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Answer for question 4: \n",
    "While their primary roles vary, both the snowmed-CT and the HL7 guidelines seek to standardize HI procedures. Snowmed-CT attempts primarily to standardize medical terminology, while HL7 guidelines primarily strive to standardize HI documentation and clinic-to-clinic correspondence. It is obvious, however, that these two are inextricably linked; neither will prosper without the other.They are also members of the JIC for Global Health Informatics Standardization, a recognised HI standards organization. They all operate on consensus-driven principles, and although snomed-CT updates approximately twice a year, the HL7 volunteer community meets approximately once every three months. Both are exceedingly rare.This is most likely attributed to the fact that all organizations are non-profits with the intention of achieving this open-access patient records norm.\n",

    "    2. Procedural - This refers to procedures in the area of health care delivery. This includes not only invasive treatments, but also patient management, imaging, education, counselling, and administrative processes.\n",

    "Controlled terminologies are meant to act as standards for maintaining clear and accurate contact among a user community. However, discordant coding is not unusual in practice, and it is becoming important to decide whether or not checked terminologies reliably produce coded results. This is particularly valid for terminologies that are comparatively abstract, such as SNOMED CT (SCT). Variations in coding can occur at any time.People with varying interests or training may use the same terminology to code the same terms in different ways; instead, they may use the same terminology to code multiple facets of the same phenomenon; and finally, different terminologies may be used to code the same or different features of the phenomenon. It is commonly accepted that bridging such gaps is a key issue in the collection of knowledge\n",

    "3.   Answer for question 3: \n",
    "\n",
    "    ---> SNOMED CT Diagram: A diagram represents a text that defines the context of a word, sentence, or association between expressions in SNOMED CT. It provides a simple, visual style to the text which reduces the number with different presentations with ambiguities and misunderstandings. Improve diagram accuracy by using a consistent approach that takes into account all relevant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---> SNOMED CT Expressions: There are two kinds of clinical phrases that use SNOMED CT concepts: precoordinated phrases with a single SNOMED CT term identifier and post coordinated phrases with multiple SNOMED CT identifications. SNOMED CT aid, a post-coordination method, allows for the portrayal of additional clinical data where necessary.In postcoordination, the accuracy that SNOMED CT can reflect without having to include all possible particular locations for any future disease across a word is dramatically enhanced. SNOMED CT expressions are a generic, logical variation of one or more word identifiers for the representation of a clinical definition.The compositional grammar of the SNOMED CT, which is a lightweight syntax of SNOMED CT expressions, expresses expressions. Pre-coordinated terms are terms that reflect the meaning of various meanings that have been predefined in SNOMED CT. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ---> Reference sets: A collection of references is a modular standard approach that aids in SNOMED CT customization and specification enhancement. This includes subset representation, vocabulary preferences for using certain terms, and mapping from and to other code structures.\n",
